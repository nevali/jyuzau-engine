<title> largefile problems </title>

<para>
  Through actual problems with handling files larger than 2 Gigabyte,
  I had to face the fact that there are serious problems with the
  largefile implementation around shared-libraries. This is bound
  to the effect that 64on32 platforms allow a preprocessor #define
  _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 which will shift the integretal type of
  off_t from a 32bit to a 64bit entity.
</para>

<para>
  That will in fact lead to problems if an application is compiled
  with a different off_t size than the shared-library it will be
  linked to. Among the problems are different sizes of the callframe
  for those functions that take an argument of off_t type. Note how
  the "seek" call uses an off_t in the middle of its arguments which
  may be 32bit or 64bit depending on a preprocessor define. And
  you know that zziplib wraps up "seek"-like calls as well.
</para>

<para>
  The observations were largely made independent of the zziplib 
  however, as a zip-file does uses 32bit offsets in its header
  fields anyway, and therefore a single zip-archive (or any of 
  its wrapped files) can not be larger than 2 Gigabyte anyway.
  I would to refer you for deeper information to my website
  about this problem-space at

<title> zziplib related </title>

<para>
  Still however the problems hold for zziplib usage when
  the functions are linked dynamically as a shared-library.
  Here we can face the fact that an application (or a higher
  level library) uses a different off_t size than the
  underlying zziplib shared-library.
</para>

<para>
  If you read the <literal>zzip/zzip.h</literal> header file then
  you will surely see a number of off_t usages around, here 
  they are wrapped in the form of zzip_off_t to get away with
  platforms not predefining off_t in the first place. Those
  functions are (at the time of writing):
<blockquote><itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> <literal>zzip_telldir</literal> (return type) </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <literal>zzip_seekdir</literal> (second param) </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <literal>zzip_tell</literal> (return type) </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <literal>zzip_seek</literal> (second param of three)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></blockquote>
</para>

<para>
  What might be not as obvious however: you will find
  also the off_t type being used in the plugin-handlers
  callback functions. That is based on the fact that
  the plugin-structures is filled by default with the
  posix-functions from the C library. A 64on32 platform
  however offers quite usually a mixedmode C library
  exporting two symbols for tell/seek calls to match
  either 32bit off_t or 64bit off_t
<blockquote><itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> <literal>zzip_plugin_io->seeks</literal> (return type and second param) </para></listitem>
<listitem><para> <literal>zzip_plugin_io->filesize</literal> (return type) </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></blockquote>
</para>

<para>
  The problem here: the application might not make use of
  zzip_seek/zzip_tell explicitly, but may be the internal
  implementation of a zzip call uses io->seeks or io->filesize.
  When an application uses plugin-io with these callbacks
  overridden then surely problems will arise.

<title> zziplib mixedmode option </title>

<para>
  I have extended the zziplib implementation to allow itself to
  live fine on 64on32 systems. The 64on32 system are like linux
  and solaris where the default off_t is 32bit and only by the
  preprocessor hint they shift into 64bit. The C library on
  these systems is a mixedmode one offering a pair for each of
  the problematic functions - lseek <emphasis>and</emphasis> lseek64 for
  example.
</para>

<para>
  The zziplib header file detects when it is present on a
  64on32 system (through hints in configured zzip/conf.h)
  and that _FILE_OFFSET_BITS has been set to 64bit. In that
  case it does automatically issue #defines that shift the
  symbol-name from zzip_seek into zzip_seek64. Likewise,
  <emphasis>all</emphasis> the *_ext_io functions are renamed into
  *_ext_io64 calls
</para>

<para>
  The zziplib library itself will also pick up the renamings
  when it is compiled with 64bit off_t - in effect an application
  with a 64bit-off_t dependency can only link with a zziplib
  compiled in 64bit-off_t mode. If the application does not
  use any call symbol with an off_t dependency then it does 
  not matter and the link will succeed. That's simply because
  function calls without an off_t dependency will not be
  renamed and they are the same for a 32bit-off_t zziplib or
  a 64bit-off_t zziplib.
</para>

<para>
  As an extra, the zziplib exports a few of its common calls
  like being a mixedmode library when you compile it both in
  64bit mode and as a shared library. In that case, the 
  resulting shared library will export symbol pairs for the
  calls with an off_t dependency, i.e. both zzip_seek and
  zzip_seek64 are present.
</para>

<para>
  Note that for reasons of being a lightweight library, the
  zziplib library does not export mixmode call pairs for
  the *_ext_io family of functions. The current generation
  of zziplib does call io->seeks unconditionally of any
  case'ing flag and so far there are no problems with the
  current design.
</para>

<title> Implementation details </title>

<para>
  In the header file zzip/zzip.h you will find the define
  ZZIP_LARGEFILE_RENAME which triggers the renaming process.
  See zzip/conf.h on the conditions where it is being triggered.
</para>

<para>
  For the implementation of the mixedmode symbol pairs, see
  zzip/dir.c for an example for the zzip_seekdir/zzip_seekdir64
  pair - here we use libtools -DPIC to detect the situation of 
  being compiled as shared-library, we use the preprocessor
  #def ZZIP_LARGEFILE_RENAME to know we are on a 64on32
  system compiled in 64bit-off_t, and we check the transitional
  largefile API to be present by looking for EOVERFLOW errno.
</para>

<para>
  When all the three are present then we simply #undef the
  renaming preprocessor macro and define a function symbol 
  (without the renaming) and call the renamed symbol 
  already compiled a few lines before. We use the pre-off_t
  type "long" for the 32bit entity of these calls. While
  we mostly let the compiler do the shrink/expand of these
  integer types, we do also sometimes check for overflows
  of the seekvalue.

<title> rpm extras and pkg-config </title>

<para>
  The provided .spec file shows how to compile both variants
  of the zziplib shared library and to install them in
  parallel in the system. Also we provide doubled sets
  of .pc files for pkg-config installation. That should make
  it a lot easier for applications to link to the correct
  library they want.
</para>

<para>
  Here are all the variants that you can find after installing
  the vanilla rpm files from zziplib.sf.net:
