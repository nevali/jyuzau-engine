<para>
  All source releases and some binary releases are listed at the
  sourceforge download area under the link show above. The sourceforge
  file area is replicated all over the world and should be accessible
  with highest bandwith in all corners of the world.

<title> Which Version To Download </title>

<para>
  Do not use 0.10.x anymore! It is listed as stable since it is the
  only release of zziplib tested to work on a few dozen platforms.
  However there were some problematic zip files out there that can
  trigger segfaults. Later zzip file decoders have extra checks and
  helper routines for that. It's just that the later zziplib have not
  been given as many crossplatform build tets as the 0.10.x generation.
</para>
<para>
  Use a 0.12.x (proto-stable) or a 0.13.x (developer) variant of 
  zziplib, especially if you intend to make heavy usage of the zip
  decoders in specialized environments - I will not add any fixes to
  the 0.10.x series anymore (it's deep frozen) but if you hit a 
  problem with 0.13.x I can help you quickly with a patch and official
  bugfix release. The later versions are regulary checked crossplatform
  atleast for <emphasis role="bold">Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, Darwin/MacOSX, Win32/NT</emphasis> 
  including i386, amd64, sparc, sparc64, powerpc where available.
</para>
<para>
  Note that all generations 0.10.x through 0.13.x are strictly
  <emphasis role="bold">backward compatible</emphasis>. There is a core API (file and dir
  handling) being binary compatible, which is also true for most
  of the helper routines (data getters). Only some rarely used
  entries are made source level compatible, and so far no one had 
  ever any problem with binary compatibility of the zziplib DLLs.
</para>
<para>
  The MSVC users are strongly advised to use a a later version as
  well since I have tested the 0.12.x/0.13.x myself and making
  some msc binary dll releases directly - prior versions were 
  thirdparty contributions which were working smoothly since I have 
  been preparing zziplib for win32 using the gcc/mingw compile suite.
