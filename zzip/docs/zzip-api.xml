<title> ZZIP Programmers Interface </title>   <subtitle>The complete API description.</subtitle>

<!--border-->

<para>
  The zzip library was orginally developped by Tomi Ollila as a
  set of zip decoder routines. Guido Draheim did pick it up and
  wrapped them under a call synopsis matching their posix
  api calls. Therefore <literal>zzip_open()</literal> has the same 
  synopsis as <literal>open(2)</literal> but it can open zipped files.
  Later the distinction was made between magic wrappers and apis
  for direct access to zip archives and the files contained
  in the archive. 
</para>
<para>
  These (three) functional apis have little helper functions 
  alongside including those to get the posix filehandle out of a 
  zzip handle and to get some attributes about the data handle
  represented by a zzip handle. Plus checking for error codes
  that may have been generated from internal checks.
