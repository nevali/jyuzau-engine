<title> Extras </title>

<para>
  The next requests circulated around other file-extensions to 
  automagically look inside filetypes that have zip-format too but 
  carry other fileextensions - most famous might be the ".PK3"
  files of ID's Quake game. There have been a number of these
  requests and in a lot of cases it dawned to me that those guys
  may have overlooked the zzip_dir_open functions to travel
  through documents of zipformat under any name - that is that the
  "magic" was not actually needed but they just wanted to read
  files in zipformat with the zziplib.
</para>

<para>
  Other requests circulated around encryption but I did reject
  those bluntly, always. Instead there have been always examples
  for doing some obfuscation around the zip-format so that the
  stock zip/unzip tools do not recognize them but a game
  software developer can pack/unpack his AI scripts and bitmaps
  into such a zipformat-like file.
</para>

<para>
  After some dead-end patches (being shipped along with the
  zziplib as configure-time compile-options - greetings to
  Lutz Sammer and Andreas Schiffler), the general approach 
  of _ext_io came up, and finally implemented (greetings go
  to Mike Nordell). The _open()-calls do now each have a
  cousin of _open_ext_io() with two/three additional arguments
  being a set of extensions to loop through our magic testing,
  a callback-handler plugin-table for obfuscation-means, 
  and (often) a bit-mask for extra-options - this bitmask even
  has "PREFERZIP" and "ONLYZIP" options to skip the real-file
  test magic in those <literal>zzip_*open</literal> functions.
</para>

<para>
  Oh, and note that the mode,ext,io extras are memorized 
  in the respecitive ZZIP_DIR handle attached, so each
  of the other calls like <literal>zzip_file_open()</literal>
  and <literal>zzip_read()</literal> will be using them. There
  are a few helper routines to help setup a new io-plugin
  where the init_io will currently just memcopy the
  default_io entries into the user-supplied plugin-struct.

<para>
  And last some stdio-like replacements were build but these
  happen to be actually just small wrappers around the other
  posix-like magic-calls. It just offers some convenience
  since wrappers like "SDL_rwops" tend to use a stringised
  open-mode - and I took the occasion to fold the zzip-bits
  for the _ext_io-calls right in there recognized via 
  special extensions to the openmode-string of zzip_fopen().

<para>
  For some reason, people did need the full set of function-calls()
  to be working on zzip-wrappers too, so here they are - if the
  ZZIP_FILE instance did wrap a real file, then the real posix-call
  will be used, otherwise it is simulated on the compressed stream
  with a zip-contained file - especially <literal>seek()</literal> can be 
  a slow operation:
  if the new point is later then just read out more bytes till we
  hit that position but if it is an earlier point then rewind to the
  beginning of the compressed data and start reading/decompression
  until the position is met.

  And last not least, there are few informative functions to
  use function-calls to read parts of the opaque structures
  of zzip-objects and their zzip-factory.
