<p class="P">
  The zziplib is a small library that allows for some parts of
  obfuscation. This is very handy in commercial projects which tend
  to incorporate a copy into their source tree. And with 
  <a href="zzip-xor.htm">obfuscation</a> it is often advisable 
  to staticlink the zziplib part and `strip` the symbols from 
  the resulting binary - in order to obfuscate the usage of a 
  standard library for semi-`encryption` of data files.
</p>

<p class="P">
  In the past I have been modifying the original LGPL license
  with a text that allows staticlinking thereby taking over a
  few paragraphs from the MPL as restrictions to do so, just to 
  defend against improper usage. However I kept being asked 
  legalese questions since most people do not want to interpret 
  added text either and on their own without a lawyer. However
  that accounts to me as well.
</p>
<p class="P">
  The public license(s) are simply there to protect me and
  my work, none of this is fixed and it is neither the only  
  possible way to get hold of a proper license. You can 
  always contact me to negotiate a special one if you do 
  need so. In most cases I will just say okay and you get 
  it for free, perhaps after some presentations I will 
  ask for som tax-reductable compensation sent to
  a wellfare organisation (never me!).
</p>
<p class="P">
  A last hint from a friend did make me think as well, as
  that the whole point of using standard public licenses
  is to protect against the need to use your own lawyers
  in the case that someone breaks the license rules. If
  one uses a standard license then it is in the interest
  of that big organization XY that the license will be
  enforced and that it will be shown valid in all courts.
  At the time of writing, no opensource license has
  ever been discussed to an end in a court trial.
</p>
<p class="P">
  That's why at last, I decided to change the COPYING 
  details once again - and start shipping under a dual
  MPL / LGPL license where each of them is separate 
  and restrictions apply alternatively. Remember that 
  each license is non-exclusive anyway, and I can give
  out as many licenses as I want, here we have one as
  MPL, then we have one as LGPL, and perhaps you ask me
  for a third text to send you over. The public ones
  are just there for you as a free choice which you can
  pick without negotiations or a fee.
</p>
<p class="P">
  And yes, you will be on established legal grounds as 
  long as you restrict your usage of the library to the 
  details contained in either COPYING text. And better
  yet, the legal possibilities have been discussed
  a few hundred times before. You will surely find
  good answers on the internet as well to guide you
  to decisions in your company whether zziplib may
  be adopted for a specific task.
</p>
<p class="P">
  The sources themselves are sent out under a dual license, 
  with both MPL and LGPL license options, and as long as 
  the MPL part is  not removed then the recpient of some
  modified sources will be entitled to the same choice
  among the public licenses of LGPL / MPL. Note that some
  example sources are given away under the ZLIB license
  which is nothing more than asking for nice behavior 
  which should have been the case even without such a text.
  <small><small>(However, it is just a fact that some people 
  happen to behave anti-social especially under pressure of 
  capitalist needs, said to lower the risks for commercial 
  success/failure of a company. You have to enforce good
  behavior or it will be "forgotten". With a license it is
  not just an error, it is a risk in itself to forget about it)
  </small></small>
</p>
<p class="P">
  As for staticlinking, let us explore that a bit - there has 
  been a debate that the LGPL warrants in fact the freedom of 
  the final recipient as you must give him the original or 
  modified sources of zziplib, to allow them to modify that 
  part again, and then (re-)link to your own parts. Your own
  parts may come in the form of precompiled objects without
  sources (as opposed to the GPL restrictions). In here, it
  is simply easier to use a dynamic linker that does the 
  re-linking job at startup-time of the whole project instead 
  to provide a makefile and linkage descriptions to let the
  user do the staticlink it into a combined executable object. 
  The latter however is often needed for embedded environments
  and it is quite of the original motivation to ask for a
  staticlink option where in fact the LGPL does allow it anyway
  as long as you ship all parts separatly as well.
</p>

<p class="P">
  The MPL defines the area of a combined work a bit differently,
  in a way it derives some ideas from BSD'ish licenses. This
  part does more care to protect the `Intellectual Properties`
  of the original developers. It does ask to prominently show 
  off that you have gone to link with the work of someone else 
  in your project. Take special note of <em>"3.5 Required Notices"</em>, 
  <em>"3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions"</em> and
  <em>"3.7 Larger Works"</em> here. Or read a lawyer text on
  the legal result of the whole license.
